# Work Day Scheduler HW#5
# Installation
This is a simple calender  application that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery. I used Day.js to work with dates and times.
# Usage
Which allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying code.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
